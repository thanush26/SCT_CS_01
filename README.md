 Caesar Cipher Tool

A beginner-friendly Python script that implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. This tool allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

 Features

- Encrypt messages using a Caesar cipher with a custom shift value (0–25)
- Decrypt messages back to their original form
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, numbers, spaces)

 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- C → F
- ...
- Z → C

Decryption simply reverses the shift.
